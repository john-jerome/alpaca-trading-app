## alpaca-trading-app
This app makes use of the trading API offered by [alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets/).
As main focus of this project was on learning, we decided to implement a simple algorithm based on momentum trading.

The repository is prepared to be deployed and run using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and their cloud version of the PostgreSQL database.
